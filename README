Radium compressor V0.0.1
Released 2013-01-17


HOW TO MAKE IT RUN

        Either:

          1. If you downloaded a tar-ball:

          "
          make
          ./radium_compressor
          "


        Or:

          2. If you checked out from a git repository:

          "
          touch audio/system_compressor.cpp
          make
          ./radium_compressor
          "


INTRODUCTION
        Radium Compressor is the system compressor in Radium distributed as a standalone jack application.

        Radium Compressor uses the stereo compressor found in effect.lib in the Faust distribution.
        This compressor is written by Julius O. Smith III.

        The Radium version is an optimized version of this compressor by using fast approximate logarithmic
        and exponential functions written by Paul Mineiro:
        http://www.machinedlearnings.com/2011/06/fast-approximate-logarithm-exponential.html

        The GUI shows accurately the sound used for compression, and how much the sound is being compressed.
        I haven't seen this in any audio compressor GUI before, but it's probably been done before.
